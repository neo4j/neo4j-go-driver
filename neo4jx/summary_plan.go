// Plan describes the actual plan that the database planner produced and used (or will use) to execute your statement.
// This can be extremely helpful in understanding what a statement is doing, and how to optimize it. For more details,
// see the Neo4j Manual. The plan for the statement is a tree of plans - each sub-tree containing zero or more child
// plans. The statement starts with the root plan. Each sub-plan is of a specific operator, which describes what
// that part of the plan does - for instance, perform an index lookup or filter results.
// The Neo4j Manual contains a reference of the available operator types, and these may differ across Neo4j versions.
type Plan interface {
	// Operator returns the operation this plan is performing.
	Operator() string
	// Arguments returns the arguments for the operator used.
	// Many operators have arguments defining their specific behavior. This map contains those arguments.
	Arguments() map[string]interface{}
	// Identifiers returns a list of identifiers used by this plan. Identifiers used by this part of the plan.
	// These can be both identifiers introduced by you, or automatically generated.
	Identifiers() []string
	// Children returns zero or more child plans. A plan is a tree, where each child is another plan.
	// The children are where this part of the plan gets its input records - unless this is an operator that
	// introduces new records on its own.
	Children() []Plan
